# Etch-a-Sketch
This is the fourth project from the Odin Project website. This project is going to be somewhat of a cross between a sketch pad and an Etch-a-Sketch.
I hope to show my progress in front-end-development with this project, which is going to be put together using a combination of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
